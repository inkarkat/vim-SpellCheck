DESCRIPTION					      *SpellCheck-description*

Vim offers built-in spell checking; when you enable it via 'spell' and
'spelllang', you can jump to the highlighted spelling errors in the buffer via
|]s|. With spelling errors scattered across a large document, Vim does not
provide an overview or report about the overall spell situation.

This plugin populates the |quickfix|-list with all spelling errors found in a
buffer to give you that overview. You can use the built-in quickfix features
to navigate to the first occurrence of a particular spell error. You can also
manage the spelling errors (mark as good / bad word, globally replace with
suggestion) directly from the quickfix window via the usual |zg|, |zw|, |z=|
etc. mappings.

A typical workflow (e.g. when composing email, commit messages, or any form of
documentation) includes writing and/or quitting the buffer, unless some
remaining spelling errors require further intervention. This plugin offers
auxiliary enhanced variants of |:bdelete|, |:write| and |:quit| that check for
spelling errors and only execute the action if none were found. So by using
these replacement commands, you'll never send or commit messages full of
embarrassing typos any more!

==============================================================================
USAGE							    *SpellCheck-usage*
						  *:SpellCheck* *:SpellLCheck*
:SpellCheck[!]		Show all spelling errors as a quickfix list.
			For multiple occurrences of the same error, the first
			location and the number of occurrences is shown.
			If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.

			In the quickfix list, spelling errors from other
			buffers are kept, so you can use something like >
			    :argdo SpellCheck
<			to gather the spelling errors from multiple buffers.

:SpellLCheck[!]		Same as ":SpellCheck", except the location list for the
			current window is used instead of the quickfix list.

MAPPINGS						 *SpellCheck-mappings*
			Inside the quickfix window, the following mappings are
			remapped so that they operate on the target spell
			error: |zg|, |zG|, |zw|, |zW|, |zug|, |zuG|, |zuw|,
			|zuW|, |z=|
			For |z=|, all identical misspellings in the buffer are
			replaced with the chosen suggestion (via
			|:spellrepall|).
			For the other commands, the taken action is appended
			to the quickfix list entry, so that the list serves as
			a record of done actions (until you refresh the list
			with a new |:SpellCheck|).

AUXILIARY COMMANDS							     *

The following set of commands just issue an error when spelling errors exist.

			   *:BDeleteUnlessSpellError* *:WriteUnlessSpellError*
		       *:WriteDeleteUnlessSpellError*   *:XitUnlessSpellError*
:BDeleteUnlessSpellError[!]	|:bdelete| the current buffer, unless it
				contains spelling errors.
:WriteUnlessSpellError[!]	|:write| the current buffer, unless it
				contains spelling errors.
:WriteDeleteUnlessSpellError[!]	|:write| and |:bdelete| the current buffer,
				unless it contains spelling errors.
:XitUnlessSpellError[!]		|:write|  the current buffer and |:quit|,
				unless it contains spelling errors.

This set of commands automatically opens the quickfix list in case of spelling
errors.				   *:BDeleteOrSpellCheck* *:WriteOrSpellCheck*
			       *:WriteDeleteOrSpellCheck*   *:XitOrSpellCheck*
:BDeleteOrSpellCheck[!]		|:bdelete| the current buffer, or show the
				spelling errors in the quickfix list.
:WriteOrSpellCheck[!]		|:write| the current buffer, or show the
				spelling errors in the quickfix list.
:WriteDeleteOrSpellCheck[!]	|:write| and |:bdelete| the current buffer,
				or show the spelling errors in the quickfix
				list.
:XitOrSpellCheck[!]		|:write| the current buffer and |:quit|, or
				show the spelling errors in the quickfix list.

							*:UpdateAndSpellCheck*
:UpdateAndSpellCheck[!]		|:update| the current buffer, and show any
				spelling errors in the quickfix list.

				A [!] is passed to the |:write| / |:bdelete| /
				|:quit| commands.

INSTALLATION					     *SpellCheck-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SpellCheck.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					     *SpellCheck-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					    *SpellCheck-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					*g:SpellCheck_DefineAuxiliaryCommands*
If you don't want the auxiliary commands, just the core |:SpellCheck| command,
use: >
    let g:SpellCheck_DefineAuxiliaryCommands = 0
If you just want some of the auxiliary commands, or under different names, or
similar commands, you can easily define them yourself, as the core spell check
functionality is available as global autoload functions. Have a look at
plugin/SpellCheck.vim for inspiration.

					 *g:SpellCheck_DefineQuickfixMappings*
If you don't want the |SpellCheck-mappings| that allow you to manage the spell
errors directly from the quickfix window, use: >
    let g:SpellCheck_DefineQuickfixMappings = 0
<
==============================================================================
INTEGRATION					      *SpellCheck-integration*
						      *g:SpellCheck_OnNospell*
By default, 'spell' will be automatically enabled when it's off, but you must
have already set 'spelllang' for a functioning spell check. If you have
written a custom auto-detection for the languages that you
frequently use, you can integrate this here through a Funcref. The custom
function must take no arguments, and set 'spell' and 'spelllang' accordingly. >
    let g:SpellCheck_OnNospell = function('SpellCheck#AutoEnableSpell')
If you want :SpellCheck to fail when 'spell' is off: >
    let g:SpellCheck_OnNospell = ''
<
						     *g:SpellCheck_OnSpellAdd*
All commands that manipulate the word lists are executed through a Funcref; by
default, it automatically enables 'spell', like |g:SpellCheck_OnNospell|.
